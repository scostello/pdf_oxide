The structure tree parsing module has been successfully integrated!

Current status:
- ✅ Structure tree types defined (StructTreeRoot, StructElem, etc.)
- ✅ Structure tree parser implemented
- ✅ Structure tree traversal implemented
- ✅ structure_tree() method added to PdfDocument

Next steps to complete Phase 1:
1. Track marked content (MCID) during text extraction
2. Integrate structure tree reading order into markdown converter
3. Test end-to-end extraction with structure tree on IRS Form 1040
